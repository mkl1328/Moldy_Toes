# Moldy_Toes
Main repo for all of the Touch designer files (.toe) that ran different stages of the project's development

## Early development
The project started early with development focusing on getting markers tracking through different acrylic + semiopaque materials. 
Early visuals were being developed simultaneously by designers.

## Simulation attempts
Originally the simulation was being run as a particle simulation, and we had a few attempts trying to get that working, but ultimately having multiple levels of interaction between TOP operaters (2d images) with 3d geometry particle systems quickly proved to be unmanageable with our understanding of touchdesigner's systems.

We later shifted our focus to a python script to manage simulating agents and bodies. 

## Audio
These were made as a modular tool to import into the main project file. 
It cycles through audio files to make a seamless randomized looping ambient background track, or pull specific sfx to play on command

## Calibration tools
This contains both project files that manage camera adjustment and projection adjustment to map marker tracking to respective spots on the table.
These were ultimately used in the final project with slightly altered settings

## Project Assembly
These files are the many attempts to piece together the separate portions of the project that were scattered across many of the previous files. 
These ended up being developed into the files used for our final Imagine display.

## EDGE
These are the files where we implemented mediapipe to do people tracking, because we did not have our table to display at the first convention. We opted for a proof of concept that displayed the visuals while using a different method for input.

The files here are missing from git as they are too large for me to commit. You can find them here for the time being: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-azdZLEIbaKRILwX1t0gtNgCGRsx_KDu?usp=drive_link

## IMAGINE
These are the final day of files. Some of them were updated on the day to adapt to issues that arose during the 7 hours of the event.
